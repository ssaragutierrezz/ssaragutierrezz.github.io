        <p class="lead mb-4">Currently, I am in my second year at the University of California, Riverside, where I am pursuing a bachelors in psychology. My journey so far has been transformative, deepening my interest in understanding human behavior, mental health, and the numerous psychological frameworks that shape our interactions and personal growth. Each course I take, whether in cognitive psychology, developmental psychology, or social psychology, has opened my eyes to the complexities of the human mind and the science behind our behaviors. I am drawn to the potential of psychology to create positive change, particularly in supporting mental health and fostering environments where people can thrive. Through my studies, Iâ€™ve developed critical thinking and analytical skills that are essential in the field of psychology. My coursework has given me a strong foundation in research methodologies, statistical analysis, and behavioral science, all of which I find intellectually stimulating and practical. Learning to analyze data, interpret psychological studies, and engage with contemporary research has been instrumental in shaping my academic and career aspirations. Iâ€™m committed to becoming not only knowledgeable but also adaptable, using these skills to approach complex problems and contribute meaningfully to the field. In addition to my academic responsibilities, I am a dedicated and hardworking student who values collaboration and teamwork. Over the past year, I have had numerous opportunities to work with diverse groups of classmates on various projects and presentations. These experiences have been invaluable, allowing me to cultivate skills in communication, active listening, and team coordination. I take pride in my ability to engage constructively with others, helping to create a supportive and productive atmosphere even when deadlines are tight and stress levels are high. I aim to bring a sense of organization, empathy, and encouragement to every group I am part of, knowing that collective success relies on each memberâ€™s commitment and cooperation. One of my strengths is my ability to perform well under pressure. Whether preparing for exams, managing multiple assignments, or working on complex group projects, I maintain a calm and focused approach that allows me to handle challenging situations effectively. I understand the importance of adaptability and patience, especially when working in teams where everyone has different perspectives and strengths. My capacity to empathize with others and my willingness to listen closely enable me to navigate diverse viewpoints and foster collaborative solutions. Looking ahead, I am excited to continue expanding my knowledge and skills, both in psychology and in the practical aspects of working with others in high-pressure environments. My goal is to make a positive impact within the field, particularly in areas related to mental health advocacy and support. I am inspired by the potential of psychology to address important social and individual issues, and I am committed to learning as much as I can to be an effective and compassionate professional. Whether through future research, clinical practice, or community engagement, I am eager to apply what I have learned to help others, promote mental well-being, and contribute to a more understanding and supportive world.<br><br>

        Outside of school, Iâ€™ve managed to transform a personal hobbyâ€”doing nailsâ€”into a rewarding part-time career. In the beginning of my senior year of high school, around August 2022, I became interested in the art of acrylic nails. Intrigued by the creativity and precision involved, I started practicing on myself and occasionally on my sister. Those first few months involved a lot of trial and error as I taught myself the basics and experimented with different techniques and designs. I spent hours watching tutorials, learning about nail anatomy, and familiarizing myself with the tools and products needed to create professional-quality nails. Practicing consistently over about six months, I developed a solid understanding of the craft and began to feel more confident in my abilities. By the end of February 2023, I reached a point where I felt ready to take on clients. At first, I worked primarily with friends and family, using their feedback to refine my techniques further. This early experience with clients was incredibly valuable, teaching me how to communicate effectively and understand each client's unique preferences and styles. It also allowed me to build rapport and trust, which are essential in a client-based business. As word of mouth spread, I began receiving inquiries from people outside my immediate circle, which boosted my confidence and motivated me to improve my skills continually. Working with clients has not only been rewarding but has also taught me valuable lessons in time management, professionalism, and customer service. Balancing my nail business with my school responsibilities has required careful planning and organization. Iâ€™ve learned how to schedule appointments, manage finances, and market my services through social media platforms, where I showcase my work and connect with potential clients. Social media has been especially instrumental in growing my client base and keeping me inspired by the latest trends and techniques in the nail industry. Each design I create reflects both my personal artistic touch and the specific desires of my clients, which makes every appointment a new creative challenge. One of the most fulfilling aspects of this journey has been seeing the joy and satisfaction on my clients' faces after their appointments. Knowing that Iâ€™ve helped someone feel confident and happy through my work is incredibly rewarding and has reinforced my commitment to this part-time career. Iâ€™m continuously seeking ways to improve my skills, investing in higher-quality materials, and even considering taking advanced courses to expand my expertise further. Ultimately, my nail business has been more than just a source of income; it has provided me with a creative outlet and a unique way to connect with others. It has given me a sense of independence and accomplishment that I carry with me into other areas of my life. Iâ€™m grateful for the experiences and challenges this endeavor has brought, as theyâ€™ve not only made me a better artist but have also instilled in me a strong sense of responsibility and resilience. I look forward to seeing how this venture continues to evolve alongside my academic and career pursuits.<br><br>

        Although I havenâ€™t had formal job experience under a traditional employer, my experience running a nail business has equipped me with a range of essential skills that I believe are invaluable for any future role I take on. Managing my nail business has required self-discipline, organization, and a high level of commitment to quality, all of which I know will serve me well in any professional setting. What started as a hobby evolved into a self-run business, which meant I needed to learn to work independently, set and manage my own schedule, and stay motivated to provide clients with the best service possible. This experience has helped me develop a strong work ethic and has taught me the importance of time management, especially when balancing my school responsibilities with my business. Handling the financial aspects of my nail business has given me practical experience in budgeting, managing expenses, and setting competitive prices for my services. Iâ€™ve become familiar with tracking income and expenses to ensure that my business remains profitable, and Iâ€™ve gained insight into the challenges of operating independently. This experience has also shown me how important it is to invest in quality materials, not only to ensure client satisfaction but also to maintain a standard of excellence in the services I provide. Working directly with clients has been one of the most rewarding and educational aspects of my business. Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to develop strong customer service skills, learning how to communicate effectively and listen closely to client needs and preferences. Each client brings unique personality traits and expectations, which has required me to adapt and stay flexible, ensuring I create a comfortable and welcoming experience for everyone. This experience has also strengthened my conflict resolution and problem-solving skills, as Iâ€™ve occasionally had to address client concerns or adapt to last-minute changes. These are abilities that I believe will be valuable in any work environment, as theyâ€™ve taught me how to remain calm, patient, and solutions-oriented in challenging situations. Additionally, running my own business has instilled in me a strong sense of accountability and responsibility. My clients rely on me to deliver high-quality results, and I take that trust seriously. Being the sole person responsible for my business has taught me the importance of meeting deadlines, maintaining professionalism, and consistently meeting high standards. Every satisfied client reinforces my dedication to this career path, and every challenge pushes me to improve. This experience has also given me valuable insight into self-motivation and resilience. The independence required to run a business has forced me to take initiative, set personal goals, and continually strive to improve my skills. Iâ€™m confident that these qualities, along with the practical experience Iâ€™ve gained, will provide a solid foundation for any future career. Whether I pursue work in psychology, business, or any other field, the skills Iâ€™ve developed through managing my nail businessâ€”self-discipline, effective communication, problem-solving, and customer serviceâ€”will help me navigate and excel in any professional environment. I am excited to apply these skills to future roles and to continue building upon them as I grow professionally.
